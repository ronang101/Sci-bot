# Sci-bot Challenge

## Introduction
Sci-bot is an AI-powered chatbot designed to answer science-related questions I created for a 24-hour coding challenge, it aims to make scientific knowledge accessible and engaging. Utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, Sci-bot provides informative and contextually relevant answers across a wide spectrum of scientific inquiries.

## How to Install and Run
To get started with Sci-bot, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a Python virtual environment and activate it.
3. Install the necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. For execution run the `Start_Chatbot.bat` file if possible (open this up and edit the file paths before running), or execute the main script directly using `python chatbot_startup.py`.

For detailed setup instructions, refer to the [technical documentation](https://ronang101.github.io/Sci-bot/technical.html).

## How to Use
To interact with Sci-bot, simply run the startup script and type in your science-related questions when prompted. Example questions include:

- "What is the boiling point of water?"
- "What is the surface temperature of the sun?"

## Contributing
I welcome contributions to improve Sci-bot's answer model and extend its capabilities. If you're interested in enhancing its understanding of complex questions or contributing in other ways, please email me at ronanj.geraghty@gmail.com.

## Documentation
For a comprehensive guide on Sci-bot's architecture, setup, usage, and development notes, visit the [documentation site](https://ronang101.github.io/Sci-bot/).

Thank you for exploring Sci-bot. Please note I am aware there is much room for improvement on this project, and I have plans to do this in the future as shown on the documentation site, but given the time restraint (and a bit of extra time I took to extend my code further) this is where I currently am with the project.
